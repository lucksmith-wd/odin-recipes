    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds small, waxy potatoes, such as red, fingerlings, or yellow finn</li>
        <li>1 pint (2 cups) cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>1 large lemon</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, grated on a microplane or finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped, for garnish
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat oven to 425°F.</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes: Slice the potatoes into 1/8 to 1/4-inch-thick rounds.</li>
        <li>Assemble veggies on baking sheet: Pile the potatoes, cherry tomatoes, and capers on a large baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Make lemon dressing and coat veggies: Cut the lemon in half and squeeze 1 tablespoon juice into a small
            bowl. Cut the remaining lemon half into several wedges and reserve for later. In the small bowl with the
            lemon, whisk in the olive oil, cumin, garlic, and 1 teaspoon salt. Pour over the potatoes, tomatoes, and
            capers and use your hands to coat everything. Spread out the potatoes, tomatoes, and capers into a single
            layer.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken: Season the chicken thighs on both sides with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and freshly ground
            black pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Add chicken thighs to baking sheet:
            Nestle the chicken thighs amongst the potatoes, tomatoes, and capers spacing them evenly across the baking
            sheet. It's ok if some of the potatoes are beneath the chicken.</li>
        <li>Roast the chicken and vegetables: Roast for about 40 minutes, spooning or brushing the chicken with pan
            juices and stirring the potatoes about halfway through. The sheet pan dinner is done when the potatoes are
            tender and starting to brown and the chicken is tender, the skin is crispy, and the meat registers 165°F
            with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
        <li>Garnish, rest the chicken for 10 minutes, and serve: Add the reserved lemon wedges to the baking sheet.
            Scatter the basil over everything. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
