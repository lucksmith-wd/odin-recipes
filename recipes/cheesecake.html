    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is the best cheesecake recipe that I've come across, and believe me, I've tried my fair share. Rich, creamy
        texture over a magnificent, crunchy graham cracker crust topped with fresh fruit. Yum!
    </p>
    <p>
        Although there are easier recipes out there, but it is 100% worth the slightly longer preparation time. You'll
        love yourself for sticking with it!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>170 g graham cracker crust</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>7 tbsp butter</li>

        <li>910 g cram cheese</li>
        <li>200 g sugar</li>
        <li>160 g sour cream</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat oven to 160C.</li>
        <li>Prepare Graham Cracker crust first by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and brown sugar, and stirring
            well. Add melted butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well.</li>
        <li>Pour crumbs into a 9” Springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of your pan. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large bowl (using a hand mixer) add cream cheese and stir until smooth
            and creamy (don't over-beat or you'll incorporate too much air).</li>
        <li>Add sugar and stir again until creamy.</li>
        <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract, and salt, and stir until well-combined. If using a stand mixer, make sure
            you pause periodically to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula so that all ingredients are
            evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten eggs, one at a time, stirring just until each egg is
            just incorporated. Once all eggs have been added, use a spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl
            again and make sure all ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour cheesecake batter into prepared springform pan. To insure against leaks, place pan on a cookie sheet
            that's been lined with foil.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to the center rack of your oven and bake on 325F (160C) for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely
            have slightly puffed and may have just begun to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back
            to the touch but will still be Jello-jiggly. Don't over-bake or the texture will suffer, which means we all
            suffer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool on top of the oven³ for 10 minutes. Once 10 minutes has passed, use a
            knife to gently loosen the crust from the inside of the springform pan (this will help prevent cracks as
            your cheesecake cools and shrinks).</li>
        <li>Allow cheesecake to cool another 1-2 hours or until near room temperature before transferring to
            refrigerator and allowing to cool overnight or at least 6 hours. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
